# Cloudflare Turnstile solver in Java

[![CI](https://github.com/ZeroCaptcha/cloudflare-turnstile-solver-java/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ZeroCaptcha/cloudflare-turnstile-solver-java/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Solve Cloudflare Turnstile in Java: a tested Maven example that gets a Cloudflare Turnstile token from the ZeroCaptcha API with java.net.http and Gson, with retries, idempotency keys and a deadline. Java 17+.

## What it does

`TurnstileSolver` gets a valid Cloudflare Turnstile token for a page you are allowed to automate, and `SolveTurnstile` prints one from the command line. You give it the page's URL and the widget's sitekey; it creates a task on the ZeroCaptcha API, waits for it, and returns the token to submit as the browser would.

- **Small:** `java.net.http.HttpClient` for the calls and Gson for JSON. Java 17 or later, built with Maven.
- **Safe to retry:** every task is created with its own `Idempotency-Key`, so a retry after a lost reply returns the same task instead of paying for a second one. 429, 502, 503 and 504 are retried after the wait the API asks for.
- **Bounded:** polls every 2 seconds, gives each request only the time left, and stops at the timeout you pass.
- **Checked failures:** a refusal or a failed task throws `ZeroCaptchaException` with the API's `code()`, such as `insufficient_funds` or `ERROR_CAPTCHA_UNSOLVABLE`, and the `requestId()` to quote to support.

## Quickstart

1. Create an account on the ZeroCaptcha website, create an API key on the dashboard and add funds (crypto, from $10). A task is charged only when it succeeds.
2. Put the API's address and your key in your environment, never in your code:

   ```sh
   export ZEROCAPTCHA_API=https://api.zerocaptcha.io
   export ZEROCAPTCHA_KEY=zc_live_...
   ```

3. Read the widget's `data-sitekey`, and its `data-action` and `data-cdata` if it sets them (the [sitekey guide](https://zerocaptcha.io/guides/find-cloudflare-turnstile-sitekey) shows where else they hide, such as the options of `turnstile.render()`), then run:

   ```sh
   mvn -q compile exec:java -Dexec.args="https://shop.example.com/login 0x4AAAAAAAB1cD2eF3gH4iJ5 login session-7f3a9c2e"
   ```

   Many sites check the action and cData when they verify the token, so pass both whenever the widget sets them.

   It prints the token. Set `PROXY_URL=http://user:pass@proxy.example.net:8080` to solve through your own proxy.

## Use it in your code

Copy `TurnstileSolver.java` and `ZeroCaptchaException.java` into your project, with Gson as a dependency:

```java
TurnstileSolver solver = new TurnstileSolver(System.getenv("ZEROCAPTCHA_API"), System.getenv("ZEROCAPTCHA_KEY"));
try {
  String token = solver.solve(
      new TurnstileSolver.Task(
          "https://shop.example.com/login", // the page with the widget
          "0x4AAAAAAAB1cD2eF3gH4iJ5", // its data-sitekey
          "login", // its data-action, or turnstile.render()'s action option; null if it sets none
          "session-7f3a9c2e", // its data-cdata, or turnstile.render()'s cData option; null if none
          null), // your proxy, such as http://user:pass@proxy.example.net:8080, or null
      Duration.ofMinutes(3));
} catch (ZeroCaptchaException error) {
  log.warn("{} (request {})", error.code(), error.requestId());
}
```

`TurnstileSolver` is safe to share between threads; each `solve` blocks its thread while it waits.

## Submit the token

The widget sends its token in the `cf-turnstile-response` form field, and the site checks it with Cloudflare's siteverify when the form arrives. Send yours the same way, straight after you get it:

```java
String form = "email=" + URLEncoder.encode("me@example.com", UTF_8)
    + "&cf-turnstile-response=" + URLEncoder.encode(token, UTF_8);
HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder(URI.create("https://shop.example.com/login"))
    .header("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded")
    .POST(HttpRequest.BodyPublishers.ofString(form))
    .build();
HttpResponse<String> response = HttpClient.newHttpClient().send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
```

With Selenium for Java, set the field in the page instead: the [Selenium example](https://github.com/ZeroCaptcha/cloudflare-turnstile-solver-selenium) shows the script, which is the same in every language.

## How it works

1. `POST /v1/tasks` with the page, the sitekey, and the action and cData if the widget sets them. The task's price is held on your balance.
2. `GET /v1/tasks/{id}` every 2 seconds while the task is `queued` or `running`.
3. `succeeded` carries `solution.token`, and the held price is charged. `failed` or `expired` carries an `errorCode`, and the hold is released: nothing is charged.

The [task lifecycle](https://zerocaptcha.io/docs/how-tasks-work) and the [errors and retries guide](https://zerocaptcha.io/docs/errors-and-retries) have every detail.

## Honest limits

- **A token works once, for 300 seconds.** Get it just before you submit, and a new one for the next submission.
- **The action and cData must match the widget's.** A token made without them can be refused by the site's siteverify check.
- **Proxies are `http` or `https`,** with the port in the URL. SOCKS is not supported.
- **Only for sites you own or are allowed to automate.** The [Acceptable Use Policy](https://zerocaptcha.io/legal/acceptable-use) applies to every task.

## FAQ

**Is there a Java SDK?**
Not yet: the official clients are for [JavaScript](https://github.com/ZeroCaptcha/zerocaptcha-js), [Python](https://github.com/ZeroCaptcha/zerocaptcha-python) and [Go](https://github.com/ZeroCaptcha/zerocaptcha-go). These two classes are small enough to copy.

**Can I use Jackson instead of Gson?**
Yes: only `solve`, `request` and `problem` touch JSON. Swap `JsonObject` for Jackson's `ObjectNode` and the rest stays.

**What does a solve cost?**
The [pricing page](https://zerocaptcha.io/pricing) lists the price per 1,000 solved tasks. Only a task that succeeds is charged.

**Why is my token refused by the site?**
Most often it was used twice, used after 300 seconds, or made without the widget's action or cData. The [siteverify errors article](https://zerocaptcha.io/blog/cloudflare-turnstile-siteverify-errors) explains each code.

## Run the tests

```sh
mvn -B test
```

The tests run the solver against a stand-in API (the JDK's `com.sun.net.httpserver`) on your machine: no key, no real task, nothing spent.
